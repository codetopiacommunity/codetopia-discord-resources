## Important Note for Users

> ‚ùó**For Linux and macOS Users**  
If you‚Äôre using **Linux** or **macOS**, you‚Äôre in luck! The commands in most of these tutorials will work seamlessly on your system, as both Linux and macOS natively support Unix commands. You can follow along with these resources without any additional setup.

> ‚ùó**For Windows Users**  
If you‚Äôre using **Windows**, you might encounter some differences since Windows does not natively support Unix commands. To follow along with these tutorials, we recommend installing [**Git Bash**](https://git-scm.com/download/win). Git Bash is a lightweight and powerful terminal that emulates a Unix-like command-line environment on Windows, allowing you to run most Unix commands just like on Linux or macOS.

By setting up Git Bash, you'll be able to use the same commands and follow these tutorials without any issues.
